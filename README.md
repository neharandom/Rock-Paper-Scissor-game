# Rock-Paper-Scissor-game
To create a Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game where users play against the computer, with the game tracking and displaying the number of wins for both the user and the computer, here’s a step-by-step guide:

steps to be followed:
1. Define the Project Structure:
Game Logic: Handle the rules for determining the winner between Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
User Input: Get the user’s choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
Computer Choice: Randomly generate the computer’s choice.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the number of wins for both the user and the computer.
Game Loop: Allow the game to continue until the user decides to quit.
2. Import Required Modules:
Use the random module to generate the computer's choice.
3. Set Up the Game Logic:
Define the function that will determine the winner between the user's choice and the computer's choice.
4. Create the Main Game Function:
This function will manage the game flow, including getting user input, generating the computer’s choice, determining the winner, and tracking the score.
5. Implement the Main Function:
This function will start the game.
6. Running the Game:
When you run the program, the game will ask the user to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors. The computer will randomly choose one as well, and the game will determine the winner. The game continues until the user types "quit".
Project Enhancements:
Best of Three: Implement a best-of-three or best-of-five mode.
Advanced Feedback: Give more detailed feedback after each round, such as explaining why the user or computer won.
Graphics (Optional): Use a graphics library like tkinter to create a GUI version of the game.
This project will help you practice working with conditionals, loops, user input, and the random module in Python.
